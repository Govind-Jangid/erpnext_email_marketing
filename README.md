## Email Marketing

Several adjustments for the E-Mail capabilities, to get them better fit for our needs.

### Manual sending capabilities

#### Different Sender name

We frequently have to send emails in the name of another colleague.
We enabled this feature to optionally change the
- Sender Name
- Sender E-Mail Address

Those parameters are now available in any E-Mail Template (for jinja), to access the changed user.
different_sender (email)
different_sender_name (full name)

The alternative name is also applied on the SMTP Envelope, as this is grabbed from the frappe.session.user by default.

#### Additional (filtered) property for E-Mail Templates

We created another Template property (additionally to the existing one), which is not hidden by default in the collapsed menu, as this is the most frequent
thing for us.

There are 3 primary things about the original one, which didn't fit to our scenario:
1. It is hidden
2. The value help is returning all of the available Templates. That's not very efficient for the coworkers, as they have to know exactly what they're looking for.
   We added a property to the Template, to assign a Template to specific DocTypes. And only those are returned in this property.
3. Replacing the whole E-Mail: We're not using this functionality to find text partials for the email, but for the whole E-Mail.
   So our new Template selection replaces the whole content of the existing E-Mail.

#### Disabled auto PDF generation (and attaching of it)

There was a hardly coded "true", which enabled "Attach Document Print" by default to each E-Mail.
So as it is the default, internal data was sent out (created in the pdf) accidentally.
In the most situations we won't attach the generation. And if we want to, then this manual step
is good in this inverted state.

We're thinking about making this dependent on the DocType, as for Invoices and Purchase Orders it
makes sense.. but for now we're fine with the disabled property.

#### Added an optional Signature Reference from each Email Template to another one.

So an Email Template may now also be a Signature.
The Signatures at the Email Account or the User are too inflexible (also jinja isn't rendered on construction),
and the Signature should be maintainable "centrally". Not each user on its own.

And for several use-cases other Signatures are needed. E.g. in service mails, a hotline Number should be
added, but on Lead Mails the signature should promote some interessting features etc. And if writing Lead Mails
for different product categories, they should be adjusted as well.

So to get this flexibility done "easy" we added an optional reference of a "Signature Email Template" for each
Email Template which should be used.
On selection, the signature will be processed with jinja in the same context, as the whole template is processed.

Those to html results are concatenated with a separating <br>.

#### Added an additional email recipient determination for several doctypes

As the basic "simple" determination of recipients works easy with Leads, it doesn't for Purchase Orders or Quotations,
when the contact or address is just maintained in the customer master data.

Now there is a priorization available, to detect the "best" destination email address for the DocTypes "Purchase Order",
"Quotation" and "Sales Order".
But this determination is only called as fallback, if no recipient email address could be found with previously called
simple (standard) determination.

# Automatic choice of Email Template for standard text.

On initiative E-Mail creation it's tried to detect a recipient and a sender e-mail address. If both can be detected,
chances are good, to generate a good pre-defined E-Mail, if an Email Template is available for the current doctype.

If all those conditions are fitting, the Email text is generated by the discovered Email Template.

# E-Mail Template jinja helpers

We added some jinja methods, which we need in frequently used templates:

## rs_salutation(contact, doc=None)

Generates a salutation by custom rules defined in DocType `EmailMktSalutation`.

A Contact name or User Name can be given.
For several DocTypes different rules can apply.
E.g.

- For a invoice to a billing center, we're not using the first name, as we don't know the person itself.
- But for a Timesheet approval, which is sent to the known Project Leader, we could want to use a more "kindly" salutation.



## rs_salutation_for_doc(doc_or_doctype, docname=None)

The same as `rs_salutation` but it receives a document, for which it detects the
best corresponding Contact itself.

## rs_target_contact_for_doc(doc)

Calls the determination routine for a Contact of a given document.
This has still a very MVP state and needs improvement for sure.

## rs_year_from_date

We oftenly need the year of a document in several emails, but only the year.
And we don't want to populate the same formatter many times. So we created
this simple helper to extract the 4 digit year from a date and return None
if nothing was applied (as is might not be always set in the corresponding
doctype).

# Receiving Inbound E-Mails from Amazon SES

The SES Rules allow to send inbound email notifications via SNS (Sx Notification Service),
but the bad thing is, that when transferring the raw MIME, only Mails with up to 150KB are
supported. And that's far away from acceptable.

So the rules need to be created to upload the mail to S3 and send a SNS as information to
ERPNext. We'll then download the mail from S3 and drop it there.

To configure Inbound E-Mail, an MX DNS Record needs to be setup to point to the correct
(Region)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/regions.html#region-endpoints].

This region needs to configure the rule to transfer inbound mails to S3 and inform via SNS.

The credentials for this service needs to be created in AWS (Create IAM User)[https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=details] with the relevant (Policy)[https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies].
